# Chapter 2 {label}

Simulating a sample of size 1000 from a *standard normal distribution* with $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$.
```{r}
x <- rnorm(1000, 0, 1) 
```

Plotting a hostogram of the sample and labbeling the plot.

```{r nice-fig, fig.cap='Here is a nice figure!', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
hist(x, col = "yellow", main = "Histogram of a sample from a standard normal")
```
