We can construct a function that does this: samp_function &lt;- function(x) { m &lt;- mean(x) n &lt;- length(x) se &lt;- 1/sqrt(n) bias &lt;- abs(-0 - m) df &lt;- n - 1 interval &lt;- qt(.975, df) * se return(c(m, bias, se, m - interval, m + interval)) } format &lt;- c(&quot;Mean&quot; = 0, &quot;Bias&quot; = 0, &quot;Std.Err&quot; = 0, &quot;Lower&quot; = 0, &quot;Upper&quot; = 0) Now we use the constructed function samp_function on all 100 samples contained in the object samples. And we also add a new column to the results that indicates which CI of the respective samples does contain \\(\\mu\\). results &lt;- samples %&gt;% vapply(., samp_function, format) %&gt;% t %&gt;% as_tibble %&gt;% mutate(Covered = ifelse(Lower &lt; 0 &amp; Upper &gt; 0, 1, 0)) We can also add a table with the sample statistics of the samples whose CIs do not contain \\(\\mu\\). results %&gt;% filter(Covered ==0) %&gt;% kableExtra::kable(caption = &quot;Here is a table of the samples&quot; ) Table 2.1: Here is a table of the samples Mean Bias Std.Err Lower Upper Covered -0.0945589 0.0945589 0.0353553 -0.1639592 -0.0251585 0 0.0740058 0.0740058 0.0353553 0.0046055 0.1434062 0 And finally we can also make a nice plot illustrating everything that we did so far. lims &lt;- aes(ymax = results$Upper, ymin = results$Lower) ggplot(results, aes(y=Mean, x=1:100, colour = Covered)) + geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 0)) + geom_pointrange(lims) + xlab(&quot;Simulations&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Means and 95% Confidence Intervals&quot;) ## Warning: Use of `results$Upper` is discouraged.

It uses the Bayes factor (Kass &amp; Raftery, 1995) to evaluate hypotheses specified using equality and inequality constraints among (linear combinations of) parameters in a wide range of statistical models. 3.4 Available tutorials Two tutorials are retrievable from the bain website under the section Tutorials. The first introducing Bayesian evaluation of informative hypotheses is provided by Hoijtink, Mulder, Lissa, &amp; Gu (2019). By reading the tutorial in combination with executing the analyses contained in easyBFtutorial.R and BFtutorial.R (available on the aforementioned website) you will quickly learn the basics of Bayesian hypothesis evaluation. The second containing introduction to Bayesian evaluation of informative hypotheses in the context of structural equation models is provided by Van Lissa et al. (2021)1. An overview of all other relevant papers concerning informative hypotheses testing and the package bain can be found here. 3.5 Usage This is how a general call to bain looks like: results &lt;- bain(x, hypothesis, fraction = 1, ...) 3.5.1 Arguments x An R object containing the outcome of a statistical analysis. Currently, the following objects can be processed: t_test() objects (Students t-test, Welchs t-test, paired samples t-test, one-group t-test, equivalence test). Note that, t_test can be used in the same way as t.test. lm() objects (ANOVA, ANCOVA, multiple regression). lavaan objects generated with the sem(), cfa(), and growth functions. A named vector containing the estimates resulting from a statistical analysis. Using this option triggers the bain.default() method. Note that, named means that each estimate has to be named such that it can be referred to in hypotheses. Wrapper functions for repeated measures ANOVA() and linear two-level models built with lmer (TBA when finished). hypothesis A character string containing the informative hypotheses to evaluate (see below the section on Specification of Hypotheses). fraction = 1 A number representing the fraction of information in the data used to construct the prior distribution (see, for example, Gu, Mulder, &amp; Hoijtink (2018)). The default value 1 denotes the minimal fraction, 2 denotes twice the minimal fraction, etc. The examples in the next chapter show how the fraction can be employed to execute a sensitivity analysis. See also Hoijtink, Mulder, Lissa, &amp; Gu (2019) for more details. ... Additional arguments (see next chapter). 3.5.2 The specification of hypotheses hypotheses is a character string that specifies which (informative) hypotheses have to be evaluated. A simple example is hypotheses &lt;- \"a &gt; b &gt; c; a = b = c;\" which specifies two hypotheses using three estimates with names a, b, and c, respectively. The hypotheses specified have to adhere to the following rules (bain may still run if you deviate from the rules, however, the output will be nonsense): When using bain with a lm or t_test or lavaan object, (unique abbreviations of) the names displayed by coef(x) have to be used (but see the section 4.3 for additional instructions if multiple group analyses are executed and/or parameters are labeled). If, for example, the names are cat and dog, c and d would be unique abbreviations. If, for example, the names are cato and cata the whole names have to be used. When using bain with a named vector, parameters are referred to using the names specified in names(). Linear combinations of parameters must be specified adhering to the following rules: Each parameter name is used at most once. Each parameter name may or may not be pre-multiplied with a number. A constant may be added or subtracted from each parameter name. A linear combination can also be a single number. Examples are: 3 * a + 5; a + 2 * b + 3 * c - 2; a - b; and 5. (Linear combinations of) parameters can be constrained using &lt;, &gt;, and =. For example, a &gt; 0 or a &gt; b = 0 or 2 * a &lt; b + c &gt; 5. The ampersand &amp; can be used to combine different parts of a hypothesis. For example, a &gt; b &amp; b &gt; c which is equivalent to a &gt; b &gt; c or a &gt; 0 &amp; b &gt; 0 &amp; c &gt; 0. Sets of (linear combinations of) parameters subjected to the same constraints can be specified using (). For example, a &gt; (b,c) which is equivalent to a &gt; b &amp; a &gt; c. The specification of a hypothesis is completed by typing ; For example, hypotheses &lt;- \"a &gt; b &gt; c; a = b = c;\", specifies two hypotheses. Hypotheses have to be compatible, non-redundant and possible. What these terms mean will be elaborated below. The set of hypotheses has to be compatible. For the statistical background of this requirement see Gu, Mulder, &amp; Hoijtink (2018). Usually the sets of hypotheses specified by researchers are compatible, and if not, bain will return an error message. The following steps can be used to determine if a set of hypotheses is compatible: Replace a range constraint, e.g., 1 &lt; a1 &lt; 3, by an equality constraint in which the parameter involved is equated to the midpoint of the range, that is, a1 = 2. Replace in each hypothesis the &lt; and &gt; by =. For example, a1 = a2&gt; a3 &gt; a4 becomes a1 = a2 = a3 = a4. The hypotheses are compatible if there is at least one solution to the resulting set of equations. For the two hypotheses considered under 1. and 2., the solution is a1 = a2 = a3 = a4 = 2. An example of two non-compatible hypotheses is hypotheses &lt;- \"a = 0; a &gt; 2;\" because there is no solution to the equations a=0 and a=2. Each hypothesis in a set of hypotheses has to be non-redundant. A hypothesis is redundant if it can also be specified with fewer constraints. For example, a = b &amp; a &gt; 0 &amp; b &gt; 0 is redundant because it can also be specified as a = b &amp; a &gt; 0. bain will work correctly if hypotheses specified using only &lt; and &gt; are redundant. bain will return an error message if hypotheses specified using at least one = are redundant. Each hypothesis in a set of hypotheses has to be possible. An hypothesis is impossible if estimates in agreement with the hypothesis do not exist. For example: values for a, b, c in agreement with a &gt; b &gt; c &amp; a &lt; c do not exist. It is the responsibility of the user to ensure that the hypotheses specified are possible. If not, bain will either return an error message or render an output table containing Infs. 3.5.3 Output The commands bain() or results&lt;-bain() followed by results or print(results) will render the default (most important) output from bain. These concern for each hypothesis specified in hypotheses the fit, complexity, Bayes factor versus the unconstrained hypothesis, Bayes factor versus its complement, posterior model probability (based on equal prior model probabilities) excluding the unconstrained hypothesis, posterior model probability including the unconstrained hypothesis, and posterior model probability of each hypothesis specified and their joint complement. Note that, all the posterior model probabilities are computed from the Bayes factors of each hypothesis versus the unconstrained hypothesis. In Hoijtink, Mulder, Lissa, &amp; Gu (2019) it is elaborated how these quantities (and the other output presented below) should be interpreted. Additionally, using summary(results, ci=0.95), a descriptives matrix can be obtained in which for each estimate, the name, the value, and a 95% central credibility interval is presented. The following commands can be used to retrieve the default and additional information from the bain output object: results$fit renders the default output, results$fit$Fit contains only the column containing the fit of each hypothesis. In the last command Fit can be replaced by Com, BF, BF.u, BF.c, PMPa, PMPb, PMPc to obtain the information in the corresponding columns of the default output. Note that, in the columns BF and BF.c the Bayes factor of the hypothesis at hand versus its complement is displayed. In the column BF.u the Bayes factor of the hypothesis at hand versus the unconstrained hypothesis is displayed. PMPa renders the posterior model probabilities (based on equal prior model probabilities) of the hypotheses specified. PMPb renders the posterior model probabilities (based on equal prior model probabilities) of the hypotheses specified plus the unconstrained hypothesis. PMPc renders the posterior model probabilities (based on equal prior model probabilities) of the hypotheses specified plus the complement of the union of these hypotheses. If, in the latter case, the complexity of the complement of the union of all hypotheses specified is smaller than .05, the hypotheses specified (almost) completely cover the parameter space. In this case PMPc is not provided and instead PMPa should be used. results$BFmatrix contains the matrix containing the mutual Bayes factors of the hypotheses specified in hypotheses. results$b contains for each of the groups in the analysis the fraction of information of the data in the group at hand used to specify the covariance matrix of the prior distribution. results$prior contains the covariance matrix of the prior distribution. results$posterior contains the covariance matrix of the posterior distribution. results$call displays the call to bain. results$model displays the named vector or the R object that is input to bain. results$n displays the sample sizes per group. results$independent_restrictions displays the number of independent constraints in the set of hypotheses under consideration. Note that, in Gu, Mulder, &amp; Hoijtink (2018) and Hoijtink, Gu, &amp; Mulder (2019) the definition given was misprinted (besides R and S also r and s should have been added to the definition). results$fit$Fit_eq displays the fit of the equality constrained part of each hypothesis. Replacing Fit_eq by Fit_in, renders the fit of the inequality constrained part of an hypothesis conditional on the fit of the equality constrained part. Com_eq, and Com_in, respectively, are the complexity counterparts of Fit_eq, and Fit_in. Note that, if you have specified two hypotheses that both have a small BF.u (close to zero), then there is no support in the data for these hypotheses. In these cases the corresponding entry in results$BFmatrix (the Bayes factor comparing both hypotheses) is very unstable and should only be interpreted if repeated analyses using different seeds (see set.seed()) render about the same results. Users areadvised to read these tutorials and this vignette before using bain.

The example concerns a one-way ANOVA. Two-way or higher order ANOVAs can only be handled by recoding all factors into one factor. If, for example, there is a factor sex with levels man and woman, and a factor age with levels young and old, these have to be recoded in a new factor sexage with levels manyoung, manold, womanyoung, womanold. If a lm ANOVA object is used, the main output table is labeled: Bayesian informative hypothesis testing for an object of class lm (ANOVA) Bayesian ANCOVA. The example concerns a one-way ANCOVA. Two-way or higher order ANCOVAs can only be handled by recoding all factors into one factor. Note that calls to lm using functions of the predictors (for example, adding squared predictors to the model using commands like y ~ x + I(x^2)) can not be processed by bain. However, one can compute a new variable (for example, a squared predictor) and add this variable to the model specification of lm. If a lm ANCOVA object is used, the main output table is labeled: Bayesian informative hypothesis testing for an object of class lm (ANCOVA). Note that, in the ANCOVA the covariates are centered! Bayesian multiple regression. Note that calls to lm using functions of the predictors (for example, adding squared predictors to the model using commands like y ~ x + I(x^2)) can not be processed by bain. However, one can compute a new variable (for example, a squared predictor) and add this variable to the model specification of lm. Note furthermore, that only if standardize = FALSE interactions between predictors should be processed, because a standardized interaction is not the same as the interaction between two standardized variables. If a lm regression with only continuous predictors object is used, the main output table is labeled: Bayesian informative hypothesis testing for an object of class lm (continuous predictors). If a lm object contains two or morefactors and, optionally, continuous predictors, the main output table islabeled: Bayesian informative hypothesis testing for an object of class lm (mixed predictors). In case of mixed predictors, the one group approach to computing Bayes factors is used (see, Hoijtink, Gu, &amp; Mulder (2019)). This may render inferior results if group sizes are unequal. Bayesian ANOVA. Sensitivity analysis. See Hoijtink, Mulder, Lissa, &amp; Gu (2019) for elaborations. Main steps: Execute the analysis with lm(). Note that, lm will apply list-wise deletion if there are cases with missing values in the variables used. Display the estimates and their names using the command coef(x). (Unique abbreviations of) these names will be used to specify hypotheses. set.seed(seed). Set seed equal to an integer number to create a repeatable random number sequence. bain uses sampling to compute Bayes factors and posterior model probabilities. It is therefore recommended to run analyses with two different seeds to ensure stability of the results. And call bain by using results &lt;- bain(x,hypotheses,fraction = 1) or results &lt;-bain(x,hypotheses,fraction = 1,standardize = FALSE). The first call to bain is used in case of lm implementations of ANOVA and ANCOVA. The second call to bain is used in case of lm implementations of multiple regression.

See the tutorial by Van Lissa et al. (2021) for further elaborations. Also, visit this link for more lavaan mini tutorials, examples and elaborations. Options: Bayesian confirmatory factor analysis Bayesian latent regression Bayesian multiple group latent regression. Note that, multiple group models with between group restrictions cannot be processed. Main steps: Specify a lavaan model using the model &lt;- ... command. In case of multiple group models, only models without between group restrictions can be processed by bain with a lavaan object as input. Secondly, execute an analysis with the sem, cfa, or growth functions (e.g: x &lt;- sem() or x &lt;- cfa() or x &lt;- growth()) implemented in lavaan. Note that, by default, lavaan will apply list-wise deletion if there are cases with missing values in the variables used. An imputation based method for dealing with missing values tailored to Bayesian hypothesis evaluation is illustrated in section 4.4. (based on Hoijtink, Gu, Mulder, &amp; Rosseel (2019)). If an analysis with lavaan is executed using missing = \"fiml\" the sample size is not corrected for the presence of missing values. This will affect (bias) the evaluation of hypotheses specified using (about) equality constraints. Specify a lavaan model using the model &lt;- ... command. In case of multiple group models, only models without between group restrictions can be processed by bain with a lavaan object as input. Display the estimates and their names using the command coef(x). Only parameters whos names contain ~ (regression coefficients), ~1 (intercepts), or =~ (factor loadings) can be used in the specification of hypotheses. (Unique abbreviations of) the names can be used to specify hypotheses. For multiple group analyses the names have to end with a group label .grp. Group labels can be assigned using commands like sesamesim$sex &lt;- factor(sesamesim$sex, labels = c(\"boy\", \"girl\")). If in a lavaan model parameters are labeled, e.g., as in model &lt;- 'age ~ c(a1, a2)*peabody + c(b1, b2)*1 then the labels have to be used in the specification of hypotheses. set.seed(seed). Set seed equal to an integer number to create a repeatable random number sequence. bain uses sampling to compute Bayes factors and posterior model probabilities. It is therefore recommended to run analyses with two different seeds to ensure stability of the results. And results &lt;- bain(x,hypotheses,fraction = 1,standardize = FALSE).

Options: Bayesian ANOVA Bayesian Welchs ANOVA (unequal within group variances) Bayesian robust (against non-normality) ANOVA (unequal within group variances) Bayesian ANCOVA Bayesian repeated measures analysis (one within factor) Bayesian repeated measures analysis (within between design) Bayesian one group logistic regression (counterpart of multiple regression) Bayesian multiple group logistic regression (counterpart of ANCOVA) Bayesian multiple regression with missing data Bayesian confirmatory factor analysis . .(add multilevel models here maybe?) . Main steps: Execute a statistical analysis. In case of a single group analysis, the following information has to be extracted from the statistical analysis and supplied to bain: A vector containing estimates of the parameters used to specify hypotheses; A list containing the covariance matrix of these parameters; and, The sample size used for estimation of the parameters. Note that, due to missing values this sample size may be smaller than the total sample size. In case of a multiple group analysis, the following information has to be extracted from the statistical analysis and supplied to bain: A vector containing estimates of the group specific parameters possibly augmented with the estimates of parameters that are shared by the groups. The structure of this vector is [parameters of group 1, parameters of group 2, , the parameters that are shared by the groups]; A list containing, per group, the covariance matrix of the parameters corresponding to the group at hand and, possibly, the augmented parameters. In the rows and columns of each covariance matrix the parameters of the group at hand come first, possibly followed by the augmented parameters. Per group the sample size used for estimation of the parameters. Note that, due to missing values this sample size may be smaller than the total sample size per group. Assign names to the estimates using names(estimates)&lt;-c(). Note that, names is a character vector containing new names for the estimates in estimates. Each name has to start with a letter, and may consist of letters, numbers, . _, : ~, =~, and ~1. These names are used to specify hypotheses (see below). An example is names &lt;- c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"). set.seed(seed). Set seed equal to an integer number to create a repeatable random number sequence. bain uses sampling to compute Bayes factors and posterior model probabilities. It is therefore recommended to run analyses with two different seeds to ensure stability of the results. results &lt;- bain(estimates, hypotheses, n=., Sigma=., group_parameters = 2, joint_parameters = 0, fraction = 1) executes bain with the following arguments: estimates A named vector with parameter estimates. hypotheses A character string containing the informative hypotheses to evaluate (the specification is elaborated below). n A vector containing the sample size of each group in the analysis. See, Hoijtink, Gu, and Mulder (2019), for an elaboration of the difference between one and multiple group analyses. A multiple group analysis is required when group specific parameters are used to formulate hypotheses. Examples are the Students and Welchs t-test, ANOVA, and ANCOVA. See the Examples section for elaborations of the specification of multiple group analyses when a named vector is input for bain. Sigma A list of covariance matrices. In case of one group analyses the list contains one covariance matrix. In case of multiple group analyses the list contains one covariance matrix for each group. See the Examples section and Hoijtink, Gu, and Mulder (2019) for further instructions. group_parameters The number of group specific parameters. In, for example, an ANOVA with three groups, estimates will contain three sample means, group_parameters = 1 because each group is characterized by one mean, and joint_parameters = 0 because there are no parameters that apply to each of the groups. In, for example, an ANCOVA with three groups and two covariates, estimates will contain five parameters (first the three adjusted means, followed by the regression coefficients of the two covariates), group_parameters = 1 because each group is characterized by one adjusted mean, and joint_parameters = 2 because there are two regression coefficients that apply to each group. In, for example, a repeated measures design with four repeated measures and two groups (a between factor with two levels and a within factor with four levels) estimates will contain eight means (first the four for group 1, followed by the four for group 2), group_parameters = 4 because each group is characterized by four means and joint_parameters = 0 because there are no parameters that apply to each of the groups. joint_parameters In case of one group joint_parameters = 0. In case of two or more groups, the number of parameters in estimates shared by the groups. In, for example, an ANCOVA, the number of joint_parameters equals the number of covariates. fraction = 1 A number representing the fraction of information in the data used to construct the prior distribution. The default value 1 denotes the minimal fraction, 2 denotes twice the minimal fraction, etc. print(results) Print the results of an analysis with bain. summary(results, ci=0.95) Present estimates and credibility intervals for the parameters used to specify the hypotheses. ci can be used to specify the confidence level of the credibility intervals.
