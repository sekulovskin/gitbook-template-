# Introduction

This is a template GitBook based on [*A GitBook Example for Teaching*](https://cjvanlissa.github.io/gitbook-demo/) and [*bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown*](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/).

This is how we would reference a book [@xie2015] or @xie2015.

This is how we would reference articles @gu2018approximated or [@hoijtink2008bayesian].
