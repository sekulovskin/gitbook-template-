# Small simulation

## Simulating a sample from a standard normal with `rnorm`.

Simulating a sample of size 1000 from a *standard normal distribution* with $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$.
```{r}
x <- rnorm(1000, 0, 1) 
```

Plotting a hostogram of the sample and labeling the plot.

```{r nice-fig, fig.cap='A histogram of a sample drawn from a standard normal distribution!', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
hist(x, col = "yellow")
```
